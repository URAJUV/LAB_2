Time complexity:

The time complexity of the Huffman algorithm is O(nlogn).
Using a heap to store the weight of each tree, each iteration requires O(logn)
time to determine the cheapest weight and insert the new weight. There are O(n) iterations, one for each item.

Space compleexity:
Space complexity is O(k) for the tree and O(n) for the decoded text.
